## Using

The following steps will guide you through the process of using this repository

### Updating `config.json`

The `config.json` file allows you to configure local requests with the following fields:

- `method`: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).
- `url`: The URL of the request that you want to map to a local file.
- `local_file`: The relative path to the local file that should be served in response to the request.

  Example `config.json`:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "http://api.example1",
      "local_file": "example1.json"
    },
    {
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://api.example2",
      "local_file": "example2.json"
    }
  ]
  ```

### Locating Local Files

Your local files, which will be served in response to requests based on the configurations in config.json, should be placed in the "local-files" folder within your project directory.

1. Open the "local-files" folder.
2. Place the local files that correspond to the paths specified in config.json within this folder. The local files should have the same relative path as configured in `local_file`.
